# Project
Final Project for 420-SF2-RE sect. 00001 (Nathan Cheng)
An individual project for one student

An individual project will be assigned to the students with predefined deliverables where students need to adhere to the rules and need to show their progression during various phases of the project to the teachers.
The students will be asked to design, implement, and deploy an application that highlights:

- Implementing class hierarchy that incorporates diverse variables and equipped with methods of different signatures.
- Integrating interfaces featuring a minimum of one-member method.
- Demonstrating polymorphism method overloading and method overriding.
- Leveraging diverse data structures (Array, List, Set, Queue, or Map) to efficiently store and process program data.
- Handling exceptions and use File systems for data I/O.
- Utilize Stream processing (with Lambda expressions or method reference).
- Collaborate through a Git repository for version control.
- Follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

The project MUST contain

- Appropriate data structures that best fit the data.
- At least two hierarchies of classes, each one has two layers (such as User, Teacher, Student) is required for the project.
- At least one user-defined interface with at least one abstract method in it.
- At least one runtime-polymorphism
- At least one textIO (reading and writing)
- At least one class implement Comparable, and at least one Comparator class.
- Unit testing for user defined methods (if applicable)

The project will focus on a specific scenario: in this case, the project will follow a similar concept that of an application for a post-office.
The application will contain functions that allow clients to manage and monitor their mails and packages, create bug reports and support requests to the staff team via tickets,
register their share information on the platform, cancel and refund certain packages after a certain amount of time. The system also includes staffs, couriers and a manager
who manages all the deliveries, tickets, operations, and roles.
